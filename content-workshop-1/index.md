# The next LexingtonKy.gov

## Goal: build a website that meets the needs of its users

* LexingtonKy.gov is the "digital front door" to the city: 7,000 people visit each day
* Our work on the website really matters!
* People come to get things done, rather than to browse
* They want a site that is simple, clear, and fast to use

## Big benefits for you as well

* The goal is content that meets the user need
* To create good content, you need tools that make life easier!
* It's still your content but with better feedback and guidance

## My role as project manager

I work with the vendor and city stakeholders to

* Implement new content management system (CMS)
* Implement design and structure
* Build flexible and reusable page templates

I facilitate to make sure everyone has clear goals and the support they need.

* Workshops for [Google Analytics](http://lexingtonky-visitors.herokuapp.com/) and user research
* Provide tools to show if content meets the user need

I also highlight helpful research and best practices. An example:

* People only read 20% of words online
* Content should be easily scannable
* Its best to use lists and short bits of text

## The current site

* Has ~2,000 pages
* The end results will likely be a few hundred pages

## [Timelines](content-migration-plan)

* December: smooth transition to a beautiful new lexingtonky.gov
* September: invite users to next.lexingtonky.gov, our work-in-progress site

## Summer workshops prepare us for next.lexingtonky.gov

- Map user needs
  * Make sure we understand who uses the site and what they want to accomplish
  * Catalog the user needs that our site should fulfill
- Prepare for build
  * _Writing for the web_ workshops
  * Work with you to determine who will write content that delivers your user needs
  * Create a content plan

## User needs are recorded as user stories

- Define the user need
- Write the user story from the perspective of the user
  * As a [type of user]
  * I need to [do something]
  * So that [I accomplish a goal]
- An example
  * As a parent
  * I need to see the ESP schedule for a particular class
  * So that I know if I can make the drop off time

It good to note that expressing a user need doesn't imply the solution. Instead it's a clear definition of the problem.

## How to define user needs

A deep understanding of the user is vital to a successful lexingtonky.gov.

> [Defining a user need](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html#defining-user-needs) must be strict and honest. For [us], it’s the need the user has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user.
>
> That’s an important distinction, because it means that you’ll be able to more accurately measure the success of your services and iteratively improve them to meet the needs of the people who’ll make use of them.

To define user needs, we:

* Gather the evidence
* Frame the need as narrowly as possible
* Be clear about what content to include and what to exclude
  * Inlude information with a clear need
  * Focus on information where government is the sole authoritative source

## What you can do now!

* Review and update content
* Record top 5 user needs for your service area(s)
* Prune old content, old pages if they do not meet a valid user need
* Continue to read _The Elements of Content Strategy_
