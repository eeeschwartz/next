# The next LexingtonKy.gov

## Goal: build a website that meets the needs of its users

* LexingtonKy.gov is the "digital front door" to the city: 7,000 people visit each day
* Our work on the website really matters!
* As opposed to browing, people come to get things done
* Make it simple, clear, and fast to use

## Big benefits for you as well

* The goal is to meet user need, rather than gov need
* But to create good content, you need tools that make life easier!
* Good feedback mechanisms and helpful guidance
* Still your content but with good tools to help

## My role as project manager

I facilitate to make sure everyone has clear goals and the support they need.

  * Workshops for [Google Analytics](http://lexingtonky-visitors.herokuapp.com/) and user research
  * Help you know if content meets the user need

I also highlight helpful research and best practices. An example:

  * People only read 20% of words online
  * Content should be easily scannable
  * Using lists and short bits of text

## The current site

* Has ~2,000 pages
* The end results will likely be 400-500 pages

## Timelines

* December: smooth transition to a beautiful new lexingtonky.gov
* September: invite users to next.lexingtonky.gov, our work-in-progress

## Summer workshops prepare us for next.lexingtonky.gov

- Map user needs
  * User needs workshops
  * Validate user needs
- Prepare for build
  * _Writing for the web_ workshops
  * Work with you to determine who will write content that delivers your user needs
  * Create a content plan

## How to record user needs

A user need deep understanding of the user is vital to a successful lexingtonky.gov.

> [Defining a user need](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html#defining-user-needs) must be strict and honest. For [us], it’s the need the user has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user.
>
> That’s an important distinction, because it means that you’ll be able to more accurately measure the success of your services and iteratively improve them to meet the needs of the people who’ll make use of them.

To define user needs, we:

* Gather the evidence
* Frame the need correctly
* Be clear about what to include and what to exclude

User needs are recorded as "user stories"

Expressing a user need mustn’t imply the solution. The user need should be expressed as a user story, so the service team can discuss and explore possible solutions.

- Define the user need
- Write the user story from the perspective of the user
- Define the acceptance criteria
- Solution is explored and delivered by the service team

## What you can do now!

* Review and update content
* Prune old content, old pages if they do not meet a valid user need
