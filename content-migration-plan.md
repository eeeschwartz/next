# Plan for alpha phase of LexingtonKY.gov redesign

_The [discovery report](http://bl.ocks.org/eeeschwartz/raw/cc85050bc819e6f388df/) lays out reasons for a redesign as well as high-level goals._

### Perform a resident survey
  * Learn what city topics people value most and prioritize them for improvement.
  * Collect a response from 0.1% of residents (~300 people).
    * Aim to represent demographics and city areas evenly.
    * Use geographic analysis tools to determine underrepresented areas.
    * Use [engagement tactics](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to reach these areas.
  * Run for about four weeks and improve reach in underrepresented areas along the way.

### Hold weekly in-person content writing sessions

Gather content writers from the high traffic service areas and make their pages simplier, clearer, and easier to use.

##### Focus on top pages

Top 100 pages make up 80% of LexingtonKY.gov traffic (not counting the homepage).

* LexServ: 6 pages account for a high percentage of overall visits.
* Parks: 158 pages total.
* Police: _todo_.
* Planning: _todo_.

##### Use collaborative writing process

* Start with a [content dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aupv-89nVqawdGdPTFZmeEUxSnIwdW9UWmFFWlVlVkE&usp=sharing#gid=14) to give writers a list of their pages with key performance indicators (KPIs).
* Talk about [successful writing for the web](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk).
 * Write collaboratively using a shared [content workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1U-kU13cPVp07wjyxfHTtDwuww1fpi6oTi0Eo4NhvM/edit#heading=h.l6xhyokye9cc) to focus on writing for a specifc user need, rather than site structure or visual design.
 * After writing each week, show the content to real users to collect feedback.
 * Port selected content to the live site, LexingtonKY.gov, to see how KPIs change.

##### Develop content strategy and site structure

* PIO oversees writing sessions to build a unified [content strategy](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/05/thinking-big-content-strategy-principles-for-government/) across all writers.
* Use a [language style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style) to unify content across writers.
* Site structure [naturally evolves](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/content-first-design) from writing process.

### Deliverables from alpha
* Analysis of Lexington resident survey including:
	* How people access the internet.
	* What information people want to find on LexingtonKY.gov.
	* Map to show the demographics and geographic areas represented.
* [Language style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style).
* [Content strategy](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/05/thinking-big-content-strategy-principles-for-government/) documentation.
* [Draft content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1U-kU13cPVp07wjyxfHTtDwuww1fpi6oTi0Eo4NhvM/edit#heading=h.l6xhyokye9cc) for high-traffic pages and suggested site structure (IA).
