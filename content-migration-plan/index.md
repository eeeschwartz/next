# Plan for alpha phase of LexingtonKY.gov redesign

_The [discovery report](/discovery-report) lays out reasons for a redesign as well as high-level goals._

### Perform a resident survey
  * Learn what city topics people value most and prioritize them for improvement.
  * Collect a response from 0.1% of residents (~300 people).
    * Aim to represent demographics and city areas evenly.
    * Use geographic analysis tools to determine underrepresented areas.
    * Use [engagement tactics](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to reach these areas.
  * Run for about four weeks and improve reach in underrepresented areas along the way.

### Hold content writing sessions each week

Gather content writers from the high traffic service areas and make their pages simplier, clearer, and easier to use.

##### Focus on top pages

Setting aside the homepage, the top **104 pages make up 80%** of remaining LexingtonKY.gov traffic. These pages are a great starting point.

|Area|Number of pages|Percentage of non-homepage traffic|Notes|
|----|-----|------|-----|
|Parks|37|25%|
|Public Safety|14|18%|
|Environmental Quality|15|14%|
|Planning|6|2%|Largely related to complex permitting processes.|

##### Areas for improvement

Use **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to track progress as the team works through the top pages.

* Pages [should target](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-for-lower-literacy-users/) reading levels between 6th and 8th grade.
  * According to reading level calculators, the top pages currently average a 9th-10th grade reading level. Many pages are also noted as difficult or confusing.
* When someone reaches a page and immediately leaves it is called a _bounce_. Bounces should trend downward.
  * The average bounce rate is currently 60%. This indicates that people are often surprised by content or don't find it useful.
* Each page should include a quick a way for users to let the City know if anything is wrong or missing.
  * After reaching a baseline of feedback, the quantity of submissions should trend downward.

##### Use collaborative writing process

* Start with a [content dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aupv-89nVqawdGdPTFZmeEUxSnIwdW9UWmFFWlVlVkE&usp=sharing#gid=14) to give writers a list of their top pages. Include KPIs so writers can see which of their pages have high bounce rates, for instance.
* Talk about [successful writing for the web](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk).
 * Write collaboratively using a shared [content workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1U-kU13cPVp07wjyxfHTtDwuww1fpi6oTi0Eo4NhvM/edit#heading=h.l6xhyokye9cc). Focus on writing for a specific user need, rather than divisive issues like site structure or visual design.
 * Use [readability tools](https://readability-score.com/) to give writers real-time feedback.
 * After each week's session, show the content to real users to see if it meets their expectations.
 * Add selected content to the live site, LexingtonKY.gov, to see how KPIs change.

##### Develop content strategy and site structure

* PIO oversees writing sessions to build a unified [content strategy](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/05/thinking-big-content-strategy-principles-for-government/) across all writers.
* Use a [language style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style) to unify content across writers.
* Site structure [naturally evolves](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/content-first-design) from writing process.

##### Make writing sessions part of the ongoing strategy

* Continue writing sessions through the beta phase to improve and prune the many remaining pages of the website.
* Once the new site is live, hold monthly or quarterly writing sessions to maintain content quality.
  * Focus on areas with lots of user feedback.
  * Set aside time to observe real users interacting with the website.

### Deliverables from alpha
* Analysis of Lexington resident survey including:
  * How people access the internet.
  * What information people want to find on LexingtonKY.gov.
  * Map to show the demographics and geographic areas represented.
* [Language style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style).
* [Content strategy](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/05/thinking-big-content-strategy-principles-for-government/) documentation.
* [Content in draft form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1U-kU13cPVp07wjyxfHTtDwuww1fpi6oTi0Eo4NhvM/edit#heading=h.l6xhyokye9cc) for high-traffic pages.
* Beginnings of site structure (Information Architecture).
