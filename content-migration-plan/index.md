# LexingtonKy.gov Alpha Phase: Content Migration Plan

_The [discovery report](/next/discovery-report) lays out reasons for a redesign as well as high-level goals._

### Perform a [resident survey](/next/)
  * Learn what city topics people value most and prioritize them for improvement
  * Collect a response from 0.1% of residents (~300 people)
    * Aim to represent demographics and city areas evenly
    * Use geographic analysis tools to determine underrepresented areas
    * Use [engagement tactics](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to reach these areas
  * Run for about four weeks and improve reach in underrepresented areas along the way

### Hold content writing sessions each week

Gather content writers from the high traffic service areas and make their pages simplier, clearer, and easier to use.

#### Focus on top pages

Setting aside the homepage, the top **104 pages make up 80%** of remaining LexingtonKy.gov traffic. These pages are a great starting point.

<!-- html output used below so we can include bootstrap styles -->
<!-- |Area|Number of pages|Percentage of non&#45;homepage traffic|Notes| -->
<!-- |&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;|&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;|&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;|&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;| -->
<!-- |Parks|37|25%| -->
<!-- |Public Safety|14|18%| -->
<!-- |Environmental Quality|15|14%| -->
<!-- |Planning|6|2%|Largely related to complex permitting processes.| -->

#### Areas for improvement

Use **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to track progress as the team works through the top pages.

* Pages [should target](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-for-lower-literacy-users/) reading levels between 6th and 8th grade
  * According to reading level calculators, the top pages currently average a 9th-10th grade reading level
  * Many pages are also noted as difficult or confusing
* When someone reaches a page and immediately leaves it is called a _bounce_
  * Bounces should trend downward
  * The average bounce rate is currently 60%, indicating that that people are often surprised by content or don't find it useful
* Each page should include a quick a way for users to let the City know if anything is wrong or missing
  * After reaching a baseline of feedback, the quantity of submissions should trend downward

#### Use collaborative writing process

* Start with a content dashboard to give writers a list of their top pages
  * Include KPIs so writers can see which of their pages have high bounce rates, for instance
* Talk about [successful writing for the web](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk)
 * Write collaboratively using a shared [content workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1U-kU13cPVp07wjyxfHTtDwuww1fpi6oTi0Eo4NhvM/edit#heading=h.l6xhyokye9cc)
   * Focus on writing for a specific user need, and leave aside issues like site structure and visual design
 * Use [readability tools](https://readability-score.com/) to give writers real-time feedback
 * After each week's session, show the content to real users to see if it meets their expectations
 * Add selected content to the live site, LexingtonKy.gov, to see how KPIs change

#### Develop content strategy and site structure

* PIO oversees writing sessions to build a unified [content strategy](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/05/thinking-big-content-strategy-principles-for-government/) across all writers
* Use a [language style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style) to unify content across writers
* Site structure [naturally evolves](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/content-first-design) from writing process

#### Make writing sessions part of the ongoing strategy

* Continue writing sessions through the beta phase to improve and prune the many remaining pages of the website
* Once the new site is live, hold monthly or quarterly writing sessions to maintain content quality
  * Focus on areas with lots of user feedback
  * Set aside time to observe real users interacting with the website

### Deliverables from alpha
* Analysis of Lexington resident survey including:
  * How people access the internet, for example mobile, tablet, and desktop and in which settings
  * What information people want to find on LexingtonKy.gov
  * Map to show the demographics and geographic areas represented
* [Language style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)
* [Content strategy](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/05/thinking-big-content-strategy-principles-for-government/) documentation
* [Content in draft form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1U-kU13cPVp07wjyxfHTtDwuww1fpi6oTi0Eo4NhvM/edit#heading=h.l6xhyokye9cc) for high-traffic pages
* Beginnings of site structure (Information Architecture)
