## Content cubes versus pages

In order to make content easy to scan, it's best to create individual content sections or "cubes" that serve a specific user need. A typical page will have several content cubes with closely related information.

A good way to build up a page is to fill out a [content cube template](content-cube.html) for each user need.

## Milestones for July 22nd

We’ve laid a good foundation, so let’s put it to work on the current site. We'll take an iterative approach, meaning that each week we create small experiments and learn from them. With time we know more and more about our users and create better experiences for them.

The first step in the process is to set an information baseline. It gives us something to measure against so that we know if our changes are improving the site.

### Observe someone using the site

Find an uncontroversial page that department stakeholders don't mind iterating changes on. Identify a user need that the page serves.

* Find a friend or family member outside of the government who doesn’t usually use the site.
* Ask them to start at the [homepage](http://www.lexingtonky.gov) and meet their need. For example: “find a lap swim at a pool near you."
* Take a few photos and capture notes on what was interesting/surprising to you. For instance:
  * Where did they get stuck?
  * Were there any misunderstandings?
  * What was surprising to you?

### Make it better!

Put your new insights to work. Think mostly about text and how it’s structured for this phase. The [content cube template](content-cube.html) from last week is a good starting point. We’ll talk about images and the best way to use them soon.

Review of content tips:

* less is more
* set user expectations right away: what information will they find when they scroll down?
* use short sentences, short sections, simple words
* include common terms that people scan for (helpful: [in-page search terms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kt9nilIxycAp6BnQGjQPLhJSy4uKujOHk63gnWjdb4w/pubhtml) and [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=car%20accident%2C%20collision&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4))

### Measure the results

Observe another person looking-up the information you’ve worked on. (Use the same process from above, starting at the [homepage](http://www.lexingtonky.gov), etc). Take a few notes about the following:

  * What did you learn?
  * How could the page be improved?
